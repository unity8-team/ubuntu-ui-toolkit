Ubuntu UI Toolkit
=================

Introduction
------------

This project consists of a set of QML components to ease the creation of
beautiful applications in QML for Ubuntu.

QML alone lacks built-in components for basic widgets like Button, Slider,
Scrollbar, etc, meaning a developer has to build them from scratch. This 
toolkit aims to stop this duplication of work, supplying beautiful components 
ready-made and with a clear and consistent API.

These components are fully themeable so the look and feel can be easily 
customized. Resolution independence technology is built in so UIs are scaled 
to best suit the display.

Other features:
- localisation through gettext

This project supports QML2 and above.


Building & Setup
----------------

You need Qt5 installed to proceed. To build this repository, run
 $ qmake
 $ make

View the components gallery by running
 $ ./gallery.sh

To install these components, run
 $ make install
You may need to be root for this command to succeed.

To use these components uninstalled, you need to have some environment
variables correctly set. This is done by either running a dedicated
(recursive) shell with
 $ ./uitk_shell.sh
or by exporting the variables in the current shell session with
 $ source export_modules_dir.sh
Note that qmake must be run before.
